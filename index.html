                    <p>“Desiccated” is most of the time assumed to be a part of processing and similar to shredding but it 
                        actually means “to dry out and remove all moisture” or a form of “dehydration” for longer shelf life. 
                        It retains about 3% of the coconut's moisture but is dry to the touch and taste.</p>

                    <p>Matured coconut water from which the vinegar is processed carries an abundance of precious minerals; 
                        such as boron, manganese, potassium, and phosphorous. Hence, a valuable resource for the body; helping 
                        it to maintain blood pressure, absorb minerals efficiently, strengthen bones, and helping in muscle 
                        and nerve function. Coconut vinegar is the hottest entrant into the Super food category and beats apple 
                        cider hands down as a weight loss aid as well as a nutrition source. Synthetic vinegar holds less than 
                        a fraction of the nutritional value provided by The Coco Factory's Coconut Vinegar. Make it your 
                        companion for salad dressings, chutneys, and marinades, and give yourself a pat on the back for making 
                        a healthy lifestyle choice.</p>

                    <h2>Virgin Coconut Oil</h2>
                    <p>
                        Virgin Coconut oil is the most versatile natural oil and known for the excellent benefits for treating 
                        hair and skin issues. Coconut oil comes from the nut (fruit) of the coconut palm belonging to the 
                        Arecaceae family. The name Coconut comes from the Old Portuguese word coco, meaning “head” or 
                        . About 75% of coconut supply is produced in the three southern states of Kerala, 
                        Tamilnadu and Karnataka. There are two varieties of coconut oil i.e.:- Refined Coconut Oil and 
                        Virgin Coconut Oil.

                    <h2>Coconut Flour</h2>
                    <p>Coconut flour is one of the many food products made from the fruit of the palm tree Cocos nucifera. 
                        Made from dried, ground coconut meat, coconut flour is a natural byproduct of coconut milk production.
                        Like wheat flour, coconut flour is a white or off-white flour commonly used in baking. Since it doesn't 
                        contain gluten, people on gluten-free diets can substitute coconut flour in their recipe for baked goods. 
                        Although coconut flour can be used as a substitute for wheat flour, many recipes must be adjusted to 
                        account for its different composition. Coconut flour is thicker than wheat flour and retains more liquid. 
                        Because it is gluten-free, dough's made with coconut flour need to be mixed longer.

                    <h2>Refined coconut oil</h2>
                    <p>Refined coconut oil is a processed oil with heat. It has a mild coconut flavor because of dried 
                        coconut or copra preparation. First, bake the coconuts before the oil extraction. Then the oil 
                        is “bleached” to kill off microbes and remove any dust particles and insects. Bleaching does not 
                        involve a household cleaner. It is a process by which the oil passed through a bleaching clay 
                        for filtration. After that, the result is a clear, mild-tasting oil.
